  <meta property="og:description" content="Do today’s youth have more opportunities than their parents? As they
  build their own social and digital networks, does that offer new routes
  to learning and friendship? How do they navigate the meaning of education
  in a digitally connected but fiercely competitive, highly individualized
  world? Based upon fieldwork at an ordinary London school, The Class
  examines young people&#x27;s experiences of growing up and learning in a
  digital world. In this original and engaging study, Livingstone and
  Sefton-Green explore youth values, teenagers’ perspectives on their
  futures, and their tactics for facing the opportunities and challenges
  that lie ahead. The authors follow the students as they move across their
  different social worlds—in school, at home, and with their friends,
  engaging in a range of activities from video games to drama clubs and
  music lessons. By portraying the texture of the students’ everyday lives,
  The Class seeks to understand how the structures of social class and
  cultural capital shape the development of personal interests,
  relationships and autonomy. Providing insights into how young people’s
  social, digital, and learning networks enable or disempower them,
  Livingstone and Sefton-Green reveal that the experience of disconnections
  and blocked pathways is often more common than that of connections and
  new opportunities.
