  and how can that criticism be &quot;employed&quot; in the culture at large?
  
  In recent years, debates about the role and direction of English
  departments have mushroomed into a broader controversy over the public
  legitimacy of literary criticism. At first glance this might seem odd:
  few taxpayers and legislators care whether the nation&#x27;s English
  professors are doing justice to the project of identifying the beautiful
  and the sublime. But in the context of the legitimation crisis in
  American higher education, the image of English departments has in fact
  played a major role in determining public attitudes toward colleges and
  college faculty. Similarly, the changing economic conditions of
  universities have prompted many English professors to rethink their
  relations to their &quot;clients,&quot; asking how literary study can serve the
  American public.
  
  What sorts of cultural criticism are teachers and scholars to produce,
  and how can that criticism be &quot;employed&quot; in the culture at large? In The
  Employment of English, Michael Bérubé, one of our most eloquent and
  gifted critics, examines the cultural legitimacy of literary study. In
  witty, engaging prose, Bérubé asserts that we must situate these
  questions in a context in which nearly half of all college professors are
  part-time labor and in which English departments are torn between their
  traditional mission of defining movements of literary history and
  protocols of textual interpretation, and their newer tasks of
  interrogating wider systems of signification under rubrics like &quot;gender,&quot;
  &quot;hegemony,&quot; &quot;rhetoric,&quot; &quot;textuality&quot; (including film and video), and
  &quot;culture.&quot;
  
  Are these new roles a betrayal of the field&#x27;s founding principles, in
  effect a short-sighted sell-out of the discipline? Do they represent
  little more that an attempt to shore up the status of--and student
  enrollments in--English? Or are they legitimate objects of literary
  study, in need of public support? Simultaneously investigating the
  economic and the intellectual ramifications of current debates, The
  Employment of English provides the clearest and most condensed account of
  this controversy to date.
