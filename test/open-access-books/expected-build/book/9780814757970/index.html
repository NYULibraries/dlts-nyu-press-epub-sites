  <meta property="og:description" content="In an age when innovative scholarly work is at an all-time high, the
  academy itself is being rocked by structural change. Funding is
  plummeting. Tenure increasingly seems a prospect for only the elite few.
  Ph.D.&#x27;s are going begging for even adjunct work. Into this tumult steps
  Cary Nelson, with a no- holds-barred account of recent developments in
  higher education.
  
  Eloquent and witty, Manifesto of a Tenured Radical urges academics to
  apply the theoretical advances of the last twenty years to an analysis of
  their own practices and standards of behavior. In the process, Nelson
  offers a devastating critique of current inequities and a detailed
  proposal for change in the form of A Twelve-Step Program for Academia.
