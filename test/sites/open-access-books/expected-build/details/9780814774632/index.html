  <meta property="og:description" content="The Clinton presidency is pivotal, occurring at a particularly sensitive
  time in American and world history. The Cold War has ended; yet Americans
  face daunting social and economic problems and are increasingly divided
  about how to address them. In this perceptive psychological portrait of
  Clinton and his presidency, expert Stanley Renshon investigates whether
  Clinton has demonstrated the requisite qualities of judgment, vision,
  character, and skill to meet the challenges he faces, domestically and
  internationally, and whether he merits another term.
  
  Renshon incisively analyzes Clinton&#x27;s sweeping ambitions, his enormous
  confidence in himself and his goals, and his success in convincing people
  that he genuinely cares about them. He reveals a Bill Clinton whose
  capacity for political success is often undermined by the very traits for
  which many praise him. His unusually high self-confidence, for instance,
  leads him to believe that he can accomplish what others have not, that he
  can, for instance, reconcile polar opposites such as liberal Democrats
  and conservative Republicans. Remarkably persistent throughout Clinton&#x27;s
  career are certain character traits which have defined him to the
  public--his tendency to make promises he can&#x27;t keep, his ability to win
  people over in person, his sudden blind rages.
  
  Renshon traces the development of Clinton&#x27;s character from his early
  family experiences to his highly successful adolescence and long
  political career. He illustrates how each step along the way--Clinton&#x27;s
  inconsistent experiences as an adored but disregarded child, his attempt
  to avoid the draft and the consequences of doing so, his marriage to
  Hillary Rodham whose own psychology has both helped and hurt him, and his
  tenure as governor during which his character first became a political
  issue--is crucial to understanding his erratic and controversial
  presidency. Renshon explores the nature of the Clinton marriage as a
  political partnership and looks at Hillary Clinton as an associate
  president.
  
  High Hopes gives us a new understanding of why a man with so many talents
  has become a president whose performance has not measured up to his
  promise.
