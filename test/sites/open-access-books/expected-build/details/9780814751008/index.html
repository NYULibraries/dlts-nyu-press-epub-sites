  This is a study of the meaning of gender as framed by the swan maiden
  tale, a story found in the folklore of virtually every culture. The swan
  maiden is a supernatural woman forced to marry, keep house, and bear

  These tales have most often been interpreted as depicting exogamous

  where she will always be the outsider. Barbara Fass Leavy believes that,
  in the societies in which the tale and its variants endured, woman was
  the other--the outsider trapped in a society that could never be her own.
  Leavy shows how the tale, though rarely explicitly recognized, is
  frequently replayed in modern literature.
  
  Beautifully written, this book reveals the myriad ways in which the
  folktales of a society reflect its cultural values, and particularly how
  folktales are allegories of gender relations. It will interest anyone
  involved in literary, gender, and cultural studies.
