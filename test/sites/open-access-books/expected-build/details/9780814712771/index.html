  . sexual bondage shackles women as much today as it has for centuries.
  In The Prostitution of Sexuality, Barry assesses where we are 15 years
  later, how far we&#x27;ve come and, more importantly, how far we have still to
  go. Shifting her focus from the sexuality of prostitution to the
  prostitution of sexuality, Barry exposes the practice of teenage sexual
  exploitation and the flourishing Asian sex tour industry, emphasizing the
  world-wide role of the expanding multi-billion dollar pornography
  industry. The work identifies the global conditions of sexual
  exploitation, from sex industrialization in developing countries to te
  normalization of prostitution in the West. The Prostitution of Sexuality
  considers sexual exploitation a political condition and thus the
  foundation of women&#x27;s subordination and the base from which
  discrimination against women is constructed and enacted. Breaking new
  ground, Barry convincingly argues for the need to integrate the struggle
  against sexual exploitation in prostitution into broader feminist
  struggles and to place it, as one of several connected issues, in the
  forefront of the feminist agenda.
  Barry concludes the book with a sampling of strategies-- international,
  regional, local, and personal--that feminist activists have employed
  successfully since the early 1980s, highlighting new international legal
  strategies for human rights resulting from her work.
