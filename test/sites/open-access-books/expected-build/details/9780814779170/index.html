The title story features a pathological dentist who seeks a quirky catharsis by decorating his apartment in hygienic dental paraphernalia.

Other stories are more humanizing: &quot;The Perils of Asthma&quot; is a sympathetic lok at a twelve-year-old boy struggling to grow up amidst his perplexing asthma, his eccentric Catholic parents, and his mystifying quasi-erections. All of the stories are grounded in the allure of language, the luxuriance of detail, and the celebration of human compulsion and obsession.">
