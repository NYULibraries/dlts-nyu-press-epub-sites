  <meta property="og:description" content="In many arenas the debate is raging over the nature of sexual
  orientation. Queer Words, Queer Images addresses this debate, but with a
  difference, arguing that homosexuality has become an issue precisely
  because of the way in which we discuss, debate, and communicate about the
  concept and experience of homosexuality. The debate over homosexuality is
  fundamentally an issue of communication-as we can see by the recent
  controversy over gays in the military. This controversy, termed by one
  gay man as the annoying habit of heterosexual men to overestimate their
  own attractiveness, has been debated in communication-sensitive terms,
  such as morale and discipline.
  
  The twenty chapters address such subjects as gay political language,
  homosexuality and AIDS on prime-time television, the politics of male
  homosexuality in young adult fiction, the identification of female
  athleticism with lesbianism, the politics of identity in the works of
  Edmund White, and coming out strategies. This is must reading for
  students of communication practices and theory, and for everyone
  interested in human sexuality.
