  <meta property="og:description" content="In 1971, Paul Harris pioneered the modern version of the black rage
  defense when he successfully defended a young black man charged with
  armed bank robbery. Dubbed one of the most novel criminal defenses in
  American history by Vanity Fair, the black rage defense is enormously
  controversial, frequently dismissed as irresponsible, nothing less than a
  harbinger of anarchy. Consider the firestorm of protest that resulted
  when the defense for Colin Ferguson, the gunman who murdered numerous
  passengers on a New York commuter train, claimed it was considering a
  black rage defense.
  
  In this thought-provoking book, Harris traces the origins of the black
  rage defense back through American history, recreating numerous dramatic
  trials along the way. For example, he recounts in vivid detail how
  Clarence Darrow, defense attorney in the famous Scopes Monkey trial,
  first introduced the notion of an environmental hardship defense in 1925
  while defending a black family who shot into a drunken white mob that had
  encircled their home.
  
  Emphasizing that the black rage defense must be enlisted responsibly and
  selectively, Harris skillfully distinguishes between applying an
  environmental defense and simply blaming society, in the abstract, for
  individual crimes. If Ferguson had invoked such a defense, in Harris&#x27;s
  words, it would have sent a superficial, wrong-headed,
  blame-everything-on-racism message. Careful not to succumb to easy
  generalizations, Harris also addresses the possibilities of a white rage
  defense and the more recent phenomenon of cultural defenses. He
  illustrates how a person&#x27;s environment can, and does, affect his or her
  life and actions, how even the most rational person can become criminally
  deranged, when bludgeoned into hopelessness by exploitation, racism, and
  relentless poverty.
