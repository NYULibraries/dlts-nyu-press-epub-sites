  <meta property="og:description" content="Whether in the form of the ongoing automotive wars, books and films such
  as Michael Crichton&#x27;s Rising Sun, or George Bush&#x27;s ill-fated trip to
  Japan in 1991, frictions between the United States and Japan have been
  steadily on the rise. Americans are bombarded with images of Japan&#x27;s
  fundamental difference; at the same time, voices in Japan call for a
  Japan That Can Say No. If the guiding principle of the Clinton
  administration is indeed new values for a new generation, how will this
  be reflected in U.S.-Japanese relations?
  Convinced that no true solution to U.S.-Japanese frictions can be
  achieved without tracing these frictions back to their origin, Ryuzo Sato
  here draws on a binational experience that spans three decades in both
  the Japanese and American business and academic communities to do just
  that. In an attempt to bridge the communication gap between the two
  countries and dispel some of the mutual ignorance and misunderstanding
  that prevails between the two, Sato addresses the following questions:
  
  --Is Japan really different?
  --Has America&#x27;s sun set?
  --How have conflicting views on the role of government affected
  U.S.-Japan relations?
  --What are the real differences in American and Japanese industrial
  policies?
  --What is the anatomy of U.S.-Japanese antagonisms?
  --What effect has the collapse of the bubble economy had on relations?
  --What is Japan&#x27;s future course? Is it truly a technological superpower?
  Can it avoid international isolation?
  
  An incisive personal look at one of the most important political and
  economic global relationships, written by a major player in the world of
  international business and finance, THE CHRYSANTHEMUM AND THE EAGLE
  provides a readable and engaging tour of U.S.-Japan relations, past and
  present.
