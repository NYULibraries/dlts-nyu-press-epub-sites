  In this controversial book, Steven Goldberg provides a compelling look at
  the intersection of two of America&#x27;s most powerful communities-law and
  science-to explain this apparent contradiction. Rarely considered in
  tandem, law and science highlight a fundamental paradox in the American
  character, the struggle between progress and process. Science, with its
  ethic of endless progress, has long fit beautifully with America&#x27;s self
  image. Law, in accordance with the American ideal of giving everyone a
  fair say, stresses process above all else, seeking an acceptable, rather
  than a scientifically correct, result. This characteristic has been
  especially influential in light of the explosive growth of the legal
  community in recent years.
  
  Exposing how the legal system both supports and restricts American
  science and technology, Goldberg considers the role and future of three
  projects-artificial intelligence, nuclear fusion, and the human genome

  social goals beyond the pure search for truth. Certain to provoke debate
  within a wide range of academic and professional communities, Culture
  Clash reveals one of the most important and defining conflicts in
  contemporary American life.

to wondrous progress in our daily lives. Americans proudly support
scientific research that yields stunning breakthroughs and Nobel prizes.
We relish the ensuing debate about the implications-moral, ethical,
practical-of these advances. Will genetic engineering change our basic
nature? Will artificial intelligence challenge our sense of human
uniqueness? And yet the actual implementation of these technologies is
often sluggish and much-delayed. From Star Trek to Jurassic Park, the
American imagination has always been fascinated by the power of
scientific technology. But what does the reality of scientific progress
mean for our society?

In this controversial book, Steven Goldberg provides a compelling look at
the intersection of two of America&#x27;s most powerful communities-law and
science-to explain this apparent contradiction. Rarely considered in
tandem, law and science highlight a fundamental paradox in the American
character, the struggle between progress and process. Science, with its
ethic of endless progress, has long fit beautifully with America&#x27;s self
image. Law, in accordance with the American ideal of giving everyone a
fair say, stresses process above all else, seeking an acceptable, rather
than a scientifically correct, result. This characteristic has been
especially influential in light of the explosive growth of the legal
community in recent years.

Exposing how the legal system both supports and restricts American
science and technology, Goldberg considers the role and future of three
projects-artificial intelligence, nuclear fusion, and the human genome
initiative-to argue for a scientific vision that infuses research with
social goals beyond the pure search for truth. Certain to provoke debate
within a wide range of academic and professional communities, Culture
Clash reveals one of the most important and defining conflicts in
contemporary American life.
