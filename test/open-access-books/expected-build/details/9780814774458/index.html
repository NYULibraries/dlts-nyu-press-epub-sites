  Within lesbian communities, formed to support lesbians in a patriarchal

  or as a political weakness. Bisexual women feel that they are regarded
  with suspicion and distrust, if not openly scorned. Drawing on her

  Rust addresses a range of questions pertaining to the political and
  social relationships between lesbians and bisexual women.
  
  By tracing the roots of the controversy over bisexuality among lesbians
  back to the early lesbian feminist debates of the 1970s, Rust argues that
  those debates created the circumstances in which bisexuality became an
  inevitable challenge to lesbian politics. She also traces it forward,
  predicting the future of sexual politics.
