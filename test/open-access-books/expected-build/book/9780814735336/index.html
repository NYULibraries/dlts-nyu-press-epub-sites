  Interweaving engaging narratives with dramatic case studies, Robert L.
  Hayman, Jr., has written a history of intelligence that will forever
  change the way we think about who is smart and who is not. To give weight
  to his assertion that intelligence is not simply an inherent
  characteristic but rather one which reflects the interests and
  predispositions of those doing the measuring, Hayman traces numerous
  campaigns to classify human intelligence. His tour takes us through the
  early craniometric movement, eugenics, the development of the IQ,
  Spearman&#x27;s &quot;general&quot; intelligence, and more recent works claiming a
  genetic basis for intelligence differences.
  
  What Hayman uncovers is the maddening irony of intelligence: that
  &quot;scientific&quot; efforts to reduce intelligence to a single, ordinal quantity
  have persisted--and at times captured our cultural imagination--not
  because of their scientific legitimacy, but because of their longstanding
  political appeal. The belief in a natural intellectual order was
  pervasive in &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;political&quot; thought both at the founding of
  the Republic and throughout its nineteenth-century Reconstruction. And
  while we are today formally committed to the notion of equality under the
  law, our culture retains its central belief in the natural inequality of
  its members. Consequently, Hayman argues, the promise of a genuine
  equality can be realized only when the mythology of &quot;intelligence&quot; is
  debunked--only, that is, when we recognize the decisive role of culture
  in defining intelligence and creating intelligence differences. Only
  culture can give meaning to the statement that one person-- or one
  group--is smarter than another. And only culture can provide our
  motivation for saying it.
  
  With a keen wit and a sharp eye, Hayman highlights the inescapable
  contradictions that arise in a society committed both to liberty and to
  equality and traces how the resulting tensions manifest themselves in the
  ways we conceive of identity, community, and merit.
