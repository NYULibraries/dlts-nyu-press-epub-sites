  <meta property="og:description" content="There is a widespread perception that the foundations of American
  democracy are dysfunctional, public trust in core institutions is
  eroding, and little is likely to emerge from traditional politics that
  will shift those conditions. Youth are often seen as emblematic of this
  crisis—frequently represented as uninterested in political life,
  ill-informed about current-affairs, and unwilling to register and vote.
  
  By Any Media Necessary offers a profoundly different picture of
  contemporary American youth. Young men and women are tapping into the
  potential of new forms of communication such as social media platforms,
  spreadable videos and memes, remixing the language of popular culture,
  and seeking to bring about political change—by any media necessary. In a
  series of case studies covering a diverse range of organizations,
  networks, and movements involving young people in the political
  process—from the Harry Potter Alliance which fights for human rights in
  the name of the popular fantasy franchise to immigration rights advocates
  using superheroes to dramatize their struggles—By Any Media Necessary
  examines the civic imagination at work. Before the world can change,
  people need the ability to imagine what alternatives might look like and
  identify paths by which change can be achieved. Exploring new forms of
  political activities and identities emerging from the practice of
  participatory culture, By Any Media Necessary reveals how these shifts in
  communication have unleashed a new political dynamism in American youth.
