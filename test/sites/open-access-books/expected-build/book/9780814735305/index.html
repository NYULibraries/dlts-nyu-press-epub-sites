  <meta property="og:description" content="In the quarter century since the Stonewall riots in New York City&#x27;s
  Greenwich Village launched the national gay-rights movement in earnest,
  LGB voters have steadily expanded their political influence. The Lavender
  Vote is the first full- length examination of lesbians, gay men, and
  bisexuals as a factor in American elections. Mark Hertzog here describes
  the differences in demographics, attitudes, and voting behavior between
  self-identified bisexuals and homosexuals and the rest of the voting
  population. He shows that lavender self- identifiers comprise a
  distinctive voting bloc equal in numbers to Latino voters, more liberal
  across the board on domestic social issues (though not necessarily on
  economic or national security issues) than non-gay voters, and extremely
  unified in high-salience elections. Further, lavender voters, contrary to
  popular belief, are up for grabs between the two major parties.
  
  Offering a clear and thorough explanation of LGB voting tendencies, this
  volume will be must-reading for elected officials, candidates for office,
  and all those interested in learning about LGB voters.
