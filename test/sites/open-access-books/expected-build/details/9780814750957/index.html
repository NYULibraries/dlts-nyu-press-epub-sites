  -From a secret collective diary kept by ten POWs
  
  A national bestseller when it first appeared in Israel, Seasons of
  Captivity is a story of human survival and hope that documents the
  experience of ten Israeli prisoners of war who shared a single jail cell
  in Egypt for more than three years.
  
  The engrossing chronicle of the prisoners&#x27; ordeal is told in their own
  words-from their capture in 1969, through six months of interrogation,
  torture, and isolation, to their movement to a common room. A watershed
  event, their transfer to shared living quarters enabled them to forge a
  community and an almost utopian social system. They held weekly meetings,
  kept a common diary, started study classes, and, among other projects,
  translated The Hobbit into Hebrew.
  
  The narrative goes on to describe the re-entry of the POWs into family
  and social roles upon their release and return to Israel in 1973. An
  exploration of the personal impact of the experience on the wives of the
  married prisoners introduces the women&#x27;s own stories of separation and
  reunion. Some of them had suddenly found themselves, in effect, single
  mothers-yet their husbands were alive. Their husbands found stronger,
  more independent women in place of the traditional ones they had left
  behind. One of the women remarks, I thought [my husband] had been angry
  at me, in part unconsciously, for being so strong and competent in his
  absence...I had managed, well, almost effortlessly.
  
  This dramatic and moving account illustrates the resilience of the human
  spirit in the face of the most dehumanizing circumstances.

A national bestseller when it first appeared in Israel, Seasons of

in Egypt for more than three years.

The engrossing chronicle of the prisoners&#x27; ordeal is told in their own

torture, and isolation, to their movement to a common room. A watershed
event, their transfer to shared living quarters enabled them to forge a

kept a common diary, started study classes, and, among other projects,
translated The Hobbit into Hebrew.

The narrative goes on to describe the re-entry of the POWs into family
and social roles upon their release and return to Israel in 1973. An
exploration of the personal impact of the experience on the wives of the
married prisoners introduces the women&#x27;s own stories of separation and
reunion. Some of them had suddenly found themselves, in effect, single
mothers-yet their husbands were alive. Their husbands found stronger,
more independent women in place of the traditional ones they had left
behind. One of the women remarks, I thought [my husband] had been angry
at me, in part unconsciously, for being so strong and competent in his
absence...I had managed, well, almost effortlessly.

This dramatic and moving account illustrates the resilience of the human
spirit in the face of the most dehumanizing circumstances.
