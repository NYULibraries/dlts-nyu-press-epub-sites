  <meta property="og:description" content="Rabbi Jacob Agus&#x27; (1911-1986) intellectual production spanned nearly a
  half century and covered an enormous historical and conceptual range,
  from the biblical to the modern era. Best known as an important Jewish
  scholar, he also held important rabbinic, teaching, and public positions.
  Although born and raised within an orthodox setting, Agus was strongly
  influenced by American liberalism and his work displayed modernizing
  sympathies, reservations about nationalism--including some forms of
  Zionism--and often severe criticisms of kabbalah. Agus crafted a unique,
  quite American, modernizing vision that ardently sought to remain in
  touch with the wellsprings of the rabbinic tradition while remaining open
  to the intellectual and moral currents of his own time.
  
  The Essential Agus brings together a sampling of Agus&#x27; most important
  published and unpublished material in one easily accessible volume. It
  will be an invaluable resource for students and researchers seeking to
  experience Agus&#x27; intellectual legacy.
