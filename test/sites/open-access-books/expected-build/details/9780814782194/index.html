  <meta property="og:description" content="In this unusual and much-needed reappraisal of Freud&#x27;s clinical
  technique, M. Guy Thompson challenges the conventional notion that
  psychoanalysis promotes relief from suffering and replaces it with a more
  radical assertion, that psychoanalysis seeks to mend our relationship
  with the real that has been fractured by our avoidance of the same.
  Thompson suggests that, while avoiding reality may help to relieve our
  experience of suffering, this short-term solution inevitably leads to a
  split in our existence.
  
  M. Guy Thompson forcefully disagrees with the recent trend that dismisses
  Freud as an historical figure who is out of step with the times. He
  argues, instead, for a return to the forgotten Freud, a man inherently
  philosophical and rooted in a Greek preoccupation with the nature of
  truth, ethics, the purpose of life and our relationship with reality.
  Thompson&#x27;s argument is situated in a stunning re-reading of Freud&#x27;s
  technical papers, including a new evaluation of his analyses of Dora and
  the Rat Man in the context of Heidegger&#x27;s understanding of truth.
  
  In this remarkable examination of Freud&#x27;s technical recommendations, M.
  Guy Thompson explains how psychoanalysis was originally designed to
  re-acquaint us with realities we had abandoned by encountering them in
  the contest of the analytic experience. This provocative examination of
  Freud&#x27;s conception of psychoanalysis reveals a more personal Freud than
  we had previously supposed, one that is more humanistic and real.
