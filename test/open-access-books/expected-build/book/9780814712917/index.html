  <meta property="og:description" content="Gail R. Benjamin reaches beyond predictable images of authoritarian
  Japanese educators and automaton schoolchildren to show the advantages
  and disadvantages of a system remarkably different from the American
  one... --The New York Times Book Review
  
  Americans regard the Japanese educational system and the lives of
  Japanese children with a mixture of awe and indignance. We respect a
  system that produces higher literacy rates and superior math skills, but
  we reject the excesses of a system that leaves children with little free
  time and few outlets for creativity and self-expression.
  
  In Japanese Lessons, Gail R. Benjamin recounts her experiences as a
  American parent with two children in a Japanese elementary school. An
  anthropologist, Benjamin successfully weds the roles of observer and
  parent, illuminating the strengths of the Japanese system and suggesting
  ways in which Americans might learn from it.
  
  With an anthropologist&#x27;s keen eye, Benjamin takes us through a full year
  in a Japanese public elementary school, bringing us into the classroom
  with its comforting structure, lively participation, varied teaching
  styles, and non-authoritarian teachers. We follow the children on class
  trips and Sports Days and through the rigors of summer vacation homework.
  We share the experiences of her young son and daughter as they react to
  Japanese schools, friends, and teachers. Through Benjamin we learn what
  it means to be a mother in Japan--how minute details, such as the way
  mothers prepare lunches for children, reflect cultural understandings of
  family and education.
