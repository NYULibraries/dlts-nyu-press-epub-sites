  <meta property="og:description" content="At the height of the Vietnam War, American society was so severely
  fragmented that it seemed that Americans may never again share common
  concerns. The media and other commentators represented the impact of the
  war through a variety of rhetorical devices, most notably the emotionally
  charged metaphor of &quot;the wound that will not heal.&quot; References in various
  contexts to veterans&#x27; attempts to find a &quot;voice,&quot; and to bring the war
  &quot;home&quot; were also common. Gradually, an assured and resilient American
  self-image and powerful impressions of cultural collectivity transformed
  the Vietnam war into a device for maintaining national unity. Today, the
  war is portrayed as a healed wound, the once &quot;silenced&quot; veteran has found
  a voice, and the American home has accommodated the effects of Vietnam.
  The scar has healed, binding Americans into a union that denies the
  divisions, diversities, and differences exposed by the war. In this way,
  America is now &quot;over&quot; Vietnam.
  
  In The Scar That Binds, Keith Beattie examines the central metaphors of
  the Vietnam war and their manifestations in American culture and life.
  Blending history and cultural criticism in a lucid style, this
  provocative book discusses an ideology of unity that has emerged through
  widespread rhetorical and cultural references to the war. A critique of
  this ideology reveals three dominant themes structured in a range of
  texts: the &quot;wound,&quot; &quot;the voice&quot; of the Vietnam veteran, and &quot;home.&quot; The
  analysis of each theme draws on a range of sources, including film,
  memoir, poetry, written and oral history, journalism, and political
  speeches. In contrast to studies concerned with representations of the
  war as a combat experience, The Scar That Binds opens and examines an
  unexplored critical space through a focus on the effects of the Vietnam
  War on American culture. The result is a highly original and compelling
  interpretation of the development of an ideology of unity in our culture.
