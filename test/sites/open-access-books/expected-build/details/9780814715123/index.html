  -The George Washington Law Review
  
  A valuable analysis of the rise, fall, and--hopefully-the revival of
  unionism in America. [The book] distills into readable form a mass of
  legal and empirical analysis of what has been happening in the workplaces
  of the United States and other industrial democracies. Most important,
  Craver has drawn a blueprint of what must be done to save collective
  bargaining in this century-must reading for scholars, lawmakers, and,
  especially, union leaders themselves.
  -Paul C. Weiler, Harvard Law SchoolAuthor of Governing the Workplace: The
  Future of Labor and Employment Law
  
  &quot;A thoroughly researched, insightful, and readable look at why American
  unions have declined. . . . This is a very informative analyis of a vital
  topic, and it will have a multidisciplinary appeal to anyone interested
  in union- management relations.
  -Peter Feuille, Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations, University
  of Illinois
  
  When employees at firms like Greyhound and Eastern Airlines walk out to
  protest wage and benefit reductions, they are permanently replaced and
  their representative labor unions destroyed. Every year, the threat or
  drama of a high-profile strike-in air traffic control towers, at Amtrak,
  or at Caterpillar-makes national headlines and, every year, several
  hundred thousand unrepresented American employees are discharged without
  good cause.
  
  During the past decade, employer opposition to unions has increased.
  Industrial and demographic changes have eroded traditional blue-collar
  labor support, and class-based myths have discouraged organization among
  white-collar workers. As the American labor movement begins its second
  century, it is confronted by challenges that threaten its very existence.
  Is the decline of the American labor movement symptomatic of a terminal
  condition?
  
  In this work, Charles Craver presents an incisive analysis of the current
  state of the American labor movement and a manifesto for how this crucial
  institution can be revitalized. Journeying with the reader from the
  inception of labor unions through their heyday and to the present, Craver
  examines the roots of their decline, the current factors which contribute
  to their dismal condition, and the actions that are needed--such as the
  recruitment of female and minority employees and appeals to white-collar
  personnel--that are necessary to ensure union viability in the 21st
  century.
  
  Craver thoughtfully discusses what labor organizations must do to
  organize new workers, to enhance their economic and political power, and
  to adapt to modern-day advances and to an increasingly global economy. He
  also suggests changes that must be made in the National Labor Relations
  Act. This book is essential reading for lawyers, scholars, and
  policy-makers, as well as all those concerned with the future of the
  labor movement.
